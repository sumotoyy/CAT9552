CAT9552
=======

This library drive ON Semiconductors CAT9552, a led driver I2C chip that can drive 16 leds and has 2 internal timers
that allow any of the 16 led to be set in 4 different states.
I never see any implementation of this chip so I wroted a library that is compatible with any Arduino and Teensy 3.
